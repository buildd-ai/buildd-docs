# Teams

Teams are the top-level organizational unit in Buildd. All resources — workspaces, accounts, skills — are scoped to a team.

## Roles

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **Owner** | Full access. Manage billing, delete team, transfer ownership. |
| **Admin** | Manage workspaces, accounts, skills, and team members. Invite new members. |
| **Member** | View workspaces and tasks. Cannot manage team settings or invite members. |

Every team has exactly one owner (the creator). Admins and members can be added via invitations.

## Team Resources

Resources are scoped to the team that owns them:

- **Workspaces** — each workspace belongs to one team
- **Accounts** (API keys) — created under a team, used by workers
- **Skills** — team-level skill registry shared across all workspaces
- **Invitations** — pending invites for new team members

## Invitations

Team admins and owners can invite new members by email:

1. Admin sends invitation with a role (`admin` or `member`)
2. Invitee receives a unique invitation token
3. Invitee accepts the invitation to join the team
4. Invitation expires if not accepted within the time limit

Invitation statuses: `pending`, `accepted`, `expired`.

## Data Model

```
teams
  id, name, slug, plan (free|pro|team)

team_members
  teamId, userId, role (owner|admin|member)

team_invitations
  id, teamId, email, role, token, status, expiresAt
```

All workspaces and accounts reference a `teamId` foreign key, ensuring resources are always team-scoped.

## Plans

Teams have a plan tier that determines limits:

| Plan | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `free` | Default tier for new teams |
| `pro` | Expanded limits |
| `team` | Full team features |
