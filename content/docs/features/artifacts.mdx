# Artifacts

Artifacts are non-code deliverables that agents produce during task execution. While code changes land in pull requests, artifacts capture everything else: analysis reports, data exports, executive summaries, curated links, and rich content.

Each artifact gets a unique shareable URL that works without authentication — share a report with stakeholders who don't have a Buildd account, embed a data export link in a Slack thread, or bookmark a summary for later reference.

## Artifact Types

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| `content` | Rich markdown content — articles, documentation drafts, design specs | A blog post draft generated from research |
| `report` | Structured analysis with findings and recommendations | Security audit results, performance benchmarks |
| `data` | Structured data — JSON, CSV, or tabular output | API response analysis, metrics aggregation |
| `link` | Curated external URL with context | A deployed preview URL, a relevant GitHub issue |
| `summary` | Concise executive summary of work performed | Sprint recap, task completion digest |

All types except `link` store their content directly in the `content` field. The `link` type requires a `url` parameter, stored in metadata, with optional `content` for descriptive context.

## Creating Artifacts

### From Claude Code (MCP)

With the Buildd MCP server connected, agents create artifacts using the `create_artifact` action on the `buildd` tool:

```
> Summarize the findings from the security audit and create a shareable report
```

The agent calls `buildd` with `action: "create_artifact"` behind the scenes. The MCP server returns the artifact ID and a shareable URL:

```
Artifact created: "Security Audit Report" (report)
ID: a1b2c3d4-...
Share URL: https://buildd.dev/share/xK9mP2...
```

#### MCP Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `workerId` | Yes | The worker ID (from the active task claim) |
| `type` | Yes | One of: `content`, `report`, `data`, `link`, `summary` |
| `title` | Yes | Human-readable title for the artifact |
| `content` | No | Markdown body, JSON data, or descriptive text |
| `url` | No | Required for `link` type — the target URL |
| `metadata` | No | Arbitrary JSON metadata to attach |

### From the REST API

Create an artifact by POSTing to the worker's artifacts endpoint:

```bash
curl -X POST https://buildd.dev/api/workers/{worker-id}/artifacts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer bld_xxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "report",
    "title": "Weekly Performance Report",
    "content": "# Performance Summary\n\n## Key Metrics\n- P95 latency: 142ms (down 12%)\n- Error rate: 0.03%\n- Throughput: 2,400 req/s"
  }'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "artifact": {
    "id": "a1b2c3d4-...",
    "workerId": "w1x2y3z4-...",
    "type": "report",
    "title": "Weekly Performance Report",
    "content": "# Performance Summary\n\n...",
    "shareToken": "xK9mP2qR...",
    "metadata": {},
    "createdAt": "2026-02-20T10:30:00Z",
    "shareUrl": "https://buildd.dev/share/xK9mP2qR..."
  }
}
```

#### Creating a Link Artifact

Link artifacts require the `url` field:

```bash
curl -X POST https://buildd.dev/api/workers/{worker-id}/artifacts \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer bld_xxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "type": "link",
    "title": "Staging Preview",
    "url": "https://staging.example.com/preview/abc123",
    "content": "Deploy preview for the new checkout flow"
  }'
```

The `url` is stored in the artifact's `metadata.url` field and rendered as a clickable link on the share page.

## Shareable Public Links

Every artifact automatically gets a share token — a cryptographically random URL-safe string. The resulting share URL is public and requires no authentication:

```
https://buildd.dev/share/xK9mP2qR7vLnW3...
```

The share page renders differently based on artifact type:

- **content / report / summary** — Rendered as formatted markdown with full styling
- **data** — Displayed as formatted JSON in a monospace code block (with pretty-printing)
- **link** — Shown as a clickable URL with optional description text

Each share page includes the artifact title, the associated task name (if available), creation date, and a link back to buildd.dev.

### Programmatic Access

Share tokens also work via the API for programmatic consumption:

```bash
curl https://buildd.dev/api/share/{token}
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "artifact": {
    "id": "a1b2c3d4-...",
    "type": "report",
    "title": "Weekly Performance Report",
    "content": "# Performance Summary\n\n...",
    "metadata": {},
    "createdAt": "2026-02-20T10:30:00Z"
  },
  "task": {
    "title": "Generate weekly performance report",
    "status": "completed"
  }
}
```

## Artifact Gallery

The dashboard provides two views for browsing artifacts:

### Workspace Artifacts

Navigate to a workspace and click **Artifacts** in the header. This shows all artifacts produced by workers in that workspace, sorted by creation date (newest first). Each artifact displays its type, title, associated task, and a link to its share page.

Internal artifact types used by the system (`task_plan`, `impl_plan`) are filtered out — you only see deliverable artifacts.

### Global Artifacts

Navigate to **Artifacts** in the main navigation to see artifacts across all workspaces you have access to. This cross-workspace view includes the workspace name on each artifact for context.

## Realtime Updates

When an artifact is created, Buildd pushes realtime events via Pusher:

- **Worker channel** — `worker:progress` event with the artifact data and share URL
- **Workspace channel** — `worker:artifact` event for dashboard live updates

This means the artifact gallery and task detail pages update instantly without polling.

## Use Cases

### Automated Reports

Schedule a recurring task that analyzes data and produces a report artifact:

```
Task: "Generate weekly security scan report"
→ Agent runs analysis
→ Creates artifact (type: report) with findings
→ Share URL posted to Slack via webhook
```

### Data Exports

Agents working with APIs or databases can export structured results:

```
Task: "Audit API endpoints for deprecated fields"
→ Agent scans OpenAPI spec
→ Creates artifact (type: data) with JSON findings
→ Stakeholders access formatted data via share link
```

### Executive Summaries

After completing complex multi-step tasks, agents can produce a summary:

```
Task: "Migrate auth module to new provider"
→ Agent completes migration, creates PR
→ Creates artifact (type: summary) with migration recap
→ Tech lead reviews summary without reading every commit
```

### Deploy Previews and External Links

Agents that trigger deployments can capture the preview URL:

```
Task: "Deploy feature branch to staging"
→ Agent pushes and triggers deploy
→ Creates artifact (type: link) with staging URL
→ QA team clicks through to test
```

## API Reference

### Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Auth | Description |
|--------|----------|------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/api/workers/{id}/artifacts` | API key | Create an artifact for a worker |
| `GET` | `/api/workers/{id}/artifacts` | API key | List all artifacts for a worker |
| `GET` | `/api/share/{token}` | None (public) | Fetch artifact by share token |

### Create Artifact Request

```
POST /api/workers/{id}/artifacts
Authorization: Bearer bld_xxx
Content-Type: application/json
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `type` | string | Yes | `content`, `report`, `data`, `link`, or `summary` |
| `title` | string | Yes | Display title |
| `content` | string | No | Markdown, JSON, or plain text body |
| `url` | string | No | Target URL (required for `link` type) |
| `metadata` | object | No | Arbitrary key-value metadata |

**Validation rules:**
- `type` must be one of the five deliverable types
- `title` is required and must be a string
- `url` is required when `type` is `link`

### Artifact Object

```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "workerId": "uuid",
  "type": "report",
  "title": "Security Audit Report",
  "content": "# Findings\n\n...",
  "storageKey": null,
  "shareToken": "xK9mP2qR7vLnW3...",
  "metadata": {},
  "createdAt": "2026-02-20T10:30:00Z",
  "shareUrl": "https://buildd.dev/share/xK9mP2qR7vLnW3..."
}
```

The `shareUrl` field is computed at response time and included in create responses. The `storageKey` field is reserved for future large-object storage support.

### MCP Tool

| Tool | Action | Access | Description |
|------|--------|--------|-------------|
