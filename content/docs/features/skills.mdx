# Skills

Skills are reusable instruction packages that give agents domain-specific expertise. Each skill is a `SKILL.md` file — the [open standard](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/agent-skills) adopted by Anthropic, OpenAI, and the broader agent ecosystem — stored in your workspace registry and delivered to agents automatically when they claim tasks.

Think of skills as npm packages for agent knowledge: structured, versioned, composable. Buildd handles the registry and delivery so you don't need to manage files across machines.

## Why Skills

Without skills, agents rely on whatever context is in the task description. This works for simple tasks but breaks down for anything that requires organizational knowledge — deploy policies, code review standards, auth patterns, testing conventions.

Skills formalize this knowledge into reusable packages:

- **Consistency** — Every agent follows the same deploy runbook, review checklist, or migration workflow
- **Composability** — Attach multiple skills to a single task (e.g., `code-review` + `security-audit`)
- **Progressive disclosure** — Agents load skill content on-demand, keeping token usage efficient
- **Cross-agent compatibility** — The SKILL.md format works with Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, and 30+ other agents

## The SKILL.md Format

Skills follow the SKILL.md standard. A skill is a directory containing a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter and markdown instructions:

```markdown
---
name: deploy-policy
description: Production deployment workflow with rollback steps and approval gates
---

# Deploy Policy

## Pre-deploy Checklist
1. All tests pass on the target branch
2. Migration files committed and reviewed
3. Environment variables verified in staging

## Deploy Steps
1. Create a release branch from `main`
2. Run `bun run build` — verify zero errors
3. Push to staging, verify smoke tests
4. Open PR to `production` branch
5. Wait for approval from #deploys channel

## Rollback
If post-deploy monitoring shows errors:
1. Revert the merge commit: `git revert HEAD`
2. Push directly to production branch
3. Post incident summary to #deploys
```

**Required fields**:
- `name` — Lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. Max 64 characters. Determines the slug.
- `description` — What the skill does and when to use it. Max 1024 characters.

### Three-tier Loading

Skills use progressive disclosure to stay token-efficient:

| Tier | When Loaded | Token Cost | Content |
|------|------------|------------|---------|
| **Metadata** | Always (at startup) | ~100 tokens | `name` and `description` from frontmatter |
| **Instructions** | When skill is triggered | Under 5k tokens | SKILL.md body — workflows, checklists, guidance |
| **Resources** | As needed | Minimal | Reference files, scripts, schemas bundled with the skill |

A workspace with 50 skills burns ~5k tokens on metadata. The agent loads 2-3 relevant skills per task. This scales far better than loading wiki pages into every prompt.

### Bundling Additional Files

Skills can include reference files beyond the main SKILL.md:

```
code-review/
├── SKILL.md              # Main instructions
├── SECURITY.md           # Security-specific checklist
├── EXAMPLES.md           # Good/bad code examples
└── schemas/
    └── pr-template.md    # PR description template
```

Reference files are stored in the skill's `metadata.referenceFiles` field and delivered alongside the SKILL.md when agents claim tasks.

## Creating Skills

### From the Dashboard

1. Navigate to your workspace
2. Click **Skills** in the header
3. Click **Register Skill**
4. Fill in:
   - **Name** — Human-readable name (e.g., "Code Review Standards")
   - **Slug** — Auto-generated from name, editable (e.g., `code-review-standards`)
   - **Description** — When the agent should use this skill
   - **SKILL.md Content** — The full instructions
5. Click **Register Skill**

Skills appear in the workspace skills list with enable/disable toggles and expandable content previews.

### From Claude Code (MCP)

With the Buildd MCP server connected, ask your agent to register a skill directly:

```
> Register a skill called "db-migration" with instructions for safe database migrations
```

The agent calls `buildd_register_skill` behind the scenes. You can also browse existing skills:

```
> What skills are available in this workspace?
```

The agent calls `buildd_list_skills` and shows you what's registered.

## Syncing Local Skills

If you install community skills locally via `npx skills add <slug>` or `npx openskills install github:org/repo`, Buildd can discover those SKILL.md files on disk and register them to your workspace.

### How It Works

1. **Install skills locally** — Skills land in `.claude/skills/{slug}/SKILL.md` in your project directory
2. **Open Local UI** — Navigate to the workspace management modal (click **Manage** next to the workspace selector)
3. **Scan** — Click **Scan .claude/skills/** in the Local Skills section at the bottom
4. **Review** — Each discovered skill shows its status:
   - **New** (green) — Not yet registered in the workspace
   - **Modified** (yellow) — Content differs from the registered version
   - **Registered** (gray) — Already registered with matching content
5. **Register** — Click **Register** on any new or modified skill. It lands in the workspace registry as **disabled by default** (pending admin review)
6. **Admin enables** — From the dashboard Skills page, toggle the skill on after reviewing its content. Skills with `source: local_scan` and `enabled: false` show a **Pending Review** badge

### Safety Model

Scanned skills register as disabled to prevent any worker from injecting instructions into the shared workspace skill registry. Only workspace admins can enable skills from the dashboard — the existing enable/disable toggle handles this without any new approval workflow.

## Attaching Skills to Tasks

When creating a task, attach skills by their slugs. The agent receives the skill instructions automatically when it claims the task.

### From the Dashboard

1. Click **New Task** from your workspace
2. Select a workspace — available skills load automatically
3. In the **Skills** section, click skill chips to select which skills this task needs
4. Only enabled skills in the workspace appear as options
5. Create the task — skills are stored with it

### From Claude Code (MCP)

```
> Create a task "Review auth module" with skills code-review and security-audit
```

The `buildd_create_task` tool accepts a `skills` array parameter. The server validates that all referenced slugs exist and are enabled.

### In Scheduled Tasks

Skills carry through to scheduled tasks. When setting up a recurring schedule from the dashboard, select skills in the task template — every task created from that schedule automatically includes them.

## How Delivery Works

When a worker claims a task with skills attached, Buildd resolves the skill content and delivers it automatically:

1. **Worker claims task** — Local UI polls for available work
2. **Server resolves skills** — Matches skill slugs to the registry, bundles the full SKILL.md content and any reference files
3. **Local UI writes files** — Skill content is written to `.claude/skills/{slug}/SKILL.md` in the project directory before the agent starts
4. **Agent discovers skills** — Claude Code natively discovers `.claude/skills/` directories and loads them using progressive disclosure
5. **Cleanup** — Skill files are removed from the project directory after the agent session ends

```
project/
└── .claude/
    └── skills/
        ├── code-review/
        │   └── SKILL.md        ← Written before agent starts
        └── security-audit/
            ├── SKILL.md        ← Written before agent starts
            └── CHECKLIST.md    ← Reference file from metadata
```

This file-based delivery follows the Claude Code convention. The agent's prompt also includes a context section listing installed skills and their paths, so the agent knows what expertise is available.

## Managing Skills

### Browsing and Editing

Navigate to your workspace and click **Skills** in the header. From the skills list you can:

- **Expand** any skill to preview its SKILL.md content
- **Toggle** skills on or off — disabled skills can't be attached to new tasks
- **Delete** skills you no longer need

To update a skill's content, use the API `PATCH` endpoint or re-register it via MCP.

## Ecosystem Compatibility

The SKILL.md format is the converging standard across the agent ecosystem. Skills created in Buildd are compatible with:

- **Claude Code** — Native `.claude/skills/` directory discovery
- **Claude API** — Skills API (`/v1/skills` endpoints) with code execution
- **Claude Agent SDK** — Filesystem-based auto-discovery
- **Codex (OpenAI)** — Same SKILL.md format
- **Cursor, Windsurf, Aider, Goose** — All support SKILL.md via community tooling

### Using Community Skills

The open skills ecosystem has thousands of ready-to-use skills. You can bring them into Buildd by copying their SKILL.md content into your workspace registry via the dashboard or MCP.

Find skills at:

- [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) — Curated directory with leaderboard, 55,000+ installs tracked
- [GitHub: anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) — Anthropic's official skill packages
- [GitHub: openai/skills](https://github.com/openai/skills) — OpenAI's official skill packages
- [SkillsMP](https://skillsmp.com) — 160k+ skills indexed from GitHub with security scanning

You can also install community skills locally using CLI tools like `npx skills add` or `npx openskills install`, then register them in Buildd to share across your team.

### Git-Based Skill Development

For teams, the recommended workflow is a private skills repo:

```
your-org/skills/
├── skills/
│   ├── deploy-policy/SKILL.md
│   ├── code-review/SKILL.md
│   └── service-auth/SKILL.md
├── AGENTS.md                    ← Universal agent discovery
└── README.md
```

You get versioning (git), review workflow (PRs), and access control (repo permissions). Register skills from this repo into your Buildd workspace to get centralized delivery and task integration.

## Writing Effective Skills

A few principles for skills that actually improve agent success rates:

1. **Be prescriptive, not descriptive** — "Run `bun test` before committing" beats "tests should pass"
2. **Include concrete examples** — Show the exact output format, file structure, or code pattern you expect
3. **Add checklists** — Agents follow checklists reliably. Use `- [ ]` format.
4. **Specify failure modes** — "If the migration fails, roll back with `git revert HEAD`" prevents the agent from guessing
5. **Keep it under 5k tokens** — If your skill is longer, split into a main SKILL.md and reference files
6. **Test empirically** — Give an agent nothing but your skill and a task. Did it succeed? If not, the doc is the bug.

## API Reference

For programmatic access, skills are managed through REST endpoints. Authentication works with both session cookies (dashboard) and API keys (`Bearer bld_xxx`).

### Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/workspaces/{id}/skills` | List skills. `?enabled=true` to filter. |
| `POST` | `/api/workspaces/{id}/skills` | Create a skill. Requires `name` and `content`. |
| `GET` | `/api/workspaces/{id}/skills/{skillId}` | Get a single skill with full content. |
| `PATCH` | `/api/workspaces/{id}/skills/{skillId}` | Update skill fields. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/workspaces/{id}/skills/{skillId}` | Delete a skill. |

### Creating a Skill (API)

```bash
curl -X POST https://buildd.dev/api/workspaces/{workspace-id}/skills \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer bld_xxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Code Review Standards",
    "content": "# Code Review\n\n## Steps\n1. Check for injection vulnerabilities..."
  }'
```

### Creating a Task with Skills (API)

```bash
curl -X POST https://buildd.dev/api/tasks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer bld_xxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "workspaceId": "ws_xxx",
    "title": "Audit checkout flow UI",
    "description": "Review the checkout pages against the latest Figma designs",
    "skills": ["ui-audit", "accessibility-check"]
  }'
```

## Team-Level Registry

Skills are registered at the **team level** and shared across all workspaces in the team. When a worker lists skills, the result merges workspace-scoped skills with team-level skills (workspace skills take precedence by slug).

### Workspace-Scoped Skills

Each workspace can have its own skills with additional controls:

- **Enabled/disabled** — toggle skills per workspace without deleting
- **Origin tracking** — `scan` (auto-discovered), `manual` (user-created), or `promoted` (from team registry)
- **Custom content** — workspace skills store their own copy of the SKILL.md content

### Registering via MCP

Admin-level accounts can register skills through the `buildd` MCP tool:

```
buildd({ action: "register_skill", params: { name: "UI Audit", content: "# UI Audit\n\n...", description: "Systematic UI review" } })
```

## Skills as Subagents

Skills can be converted into subagents for the Claude Agent SDK's Task delegation feature. When `useSkillAgents` is enabled, each skill becomes a named agent that the main worker can delegate to:

```typescript
agents: {
  'ui-audit': {
    description: 'Systematic UI review against design specs',
    prompt: '<full SKILL.md content>',
    tools: ['Read', 'Grep', 'Glob', 'Bash', 'Edit', 'Write'],
    model: 'inherit',
  }
}
```

The main worker can then delegate specialized work via the `Task` tool rather than executing everything in its own context. This keeps context clean and allows parallel execution of independent skill work.

This feature requires the `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` environment variable.
