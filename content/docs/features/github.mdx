# GitHub Integration

Buildd integrates with GitHub via a GitHub App. This enables automatic task creation from issues, PR creation from workers, and repo syncing.

## Installation

1. Navigate to your team settings in the Buildd dashboard
2. Click **"Install GitHub App"**
3. Select which GitHub organization or user account to install on
4. Choose repositories: **All repositories** or **Selected repositories**
5. Authorize the app

After installation, Buildd stores the installation details and syncs accessible repositories.

## Repo Syncing

Once installed, Buildd fetches and stores metadata for all accessible repositories:

- Repository name, owner, and full name (`owner/repo`)
- Default branch
- Private/public status
- HTML URL and description

Repositories are refreshed when the installation is updated (repos added/removed).

## Linking Repos to Workspaces

Connect a GitHub repository to a workspace to enable:

- **Automatic workspace detection** — the MCP server detects which workspace to use by reading the `git remote origin` URL
- **PR creation** — workers can create pull requests via the API
- **Issue-to-task sync** — new GitHub issues become Buildd tasks automatically

## Webhooks

Buildd listens for GitHub webhook events:

### `issues` — Automatic Task Creation

When a new issue is opened on a linked repository, Buildd automatically creates a task:

- Task title matches the issue title
- Task description includes the issue body
- Task links back to the GitHub issue via `externalUrl`
- The source is tracked as `github`

### `installation` — App Lifecycle

Handles installation created, deleted, and suspended events to keep the database in sync.

### `installation_repositories` — Repo Changes

When repositories are added or removed from the installation, Buildd updates its repo list.

## PR Creation from Workers

Workers can create pull requests through the Buildd API after pushing their changes:

```bash
# Via MCP server
buildd_create_pr \
  --workerId "worker-id" \
  --title "feat: add user settings page" \
  --head "buildd/task-123" \
  --base "main" \
  --body "Implements user settings with profile editing"
```

The API uses the GitHub App's installation token to create the PR on behalf of the worker. The PR URL and number are stored on the worker record for tracking.

### API Endpoint

```
POST /api/github/pr
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer bld_xxx

{
  "workerId": "worker-uuid",
  "title": "PR title",
  "head": "branch-name",
  "base": "main",
  "body": "PR description",
  "draft": false
}
```

## Data Model

```
github_installations
  id, installationId, accountType, accountLogin,
  accessToken, tokenExpiresAt, permissions, repositorySelection

github_repos
  id, installationId, repoId, fullName, name, owner,
  private, defaultBranch, htmlUrl, description
```

Workspaces reference GitHub repos via `githubRepoId` and `githubInstallationId` foreign keys.
