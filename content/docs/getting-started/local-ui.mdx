# Local UI Setup

The Local UI is a standalone worker runner that connects to buildd.dev. It runs on your machine (or a remote workspace like Coder) and executes tasks using the Claude Agent SDK.

## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtime
- A buildd.dev account with an API key

## Quick Start

```bash
cd apps/local-ui
bun install
bun start
```

On first launch, open `http://localhost:8766` in your browser to complete setup (API key, workspace linking).

## Configuration

All config is stored in `~/.buildd/config.json`. The file is created automatically during setup.

### Config Fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `apiKey` | string | — | Buildd API key (`bld_xxx`) |
| `localUiUrl` | string | auto-detected | Public URL for this instance (see [URL Resolution](#url-resolution)) |
| `maxConcurrent` | number | `3` | Max concurrent workers |
| `model` | string | `claude-opus-4-6` | Claude model to use |
| `acceptRemoteTasks` | boolean | `true` | Accept task assignments from the dashboard |
| `bypassPermissions` | boolean | `false` | Skip permission prompts (dangerous commands still blocked) |
| `builddServer` | string | `https://buildd.dev` | Server URL override |
| `openBrowser` | boolean | — | Auto-open browser on startup |
| `llmProvider` | string | `anthropic` | LLM provider: `anthropic` or `openrouter` |
| `llmApiKey` | string | — | Provider API key (for OpenRouter, etc.) |
| `llmBaseUrl` | string | — | Custom LLM base URL |
| `pusherKey` | string | — | Pusher key for realtime events |
| `pusherCluster` | string | — | Pusher cluster (e.g. `us2`) |

### Environment Variables

Env vars override config file values. Useful for CI/Docker.

| Variable | Overrides |
|----------|-----------|
| `BUILDD_API_KEY` | `apiKey` |
| `LOCAL_UI_URL` | `localUiUrl` |
| `PORT` | Listen port (default: `8766`) |
| `PROJECTS_ROOT` | Comma-separated project directories (e.g. `~/projects,~/work`) |
| `MAX_CONCURRENT` | `maxConcurrent` |
| `MODEL` | `model` |
| `BUILDD_SERVER` | `builddServer` |
| `BUILDD_CONFIG` | Config file path (default: `~/.buildd/config.json`) |
| `LLM_PROVIDER` | `llmProvider` |
| `LLM_API_KEY` | `llmApiKey` |
| `LLM_BASE_URL` | `llmBaseUrl` |

## URL Resolution

The `localUiUrl` determines how the buildd.dev dashboard links back to this instance (the "Open" and "Open Terminal" buttons). It's resolved once at startup in this order:

1. `LOCAL_UI_URL` env var (highest priority)
2. `localUiUrl` in `~/.buildd/config.json`
3. Tailscale auto-detect — runs `tailscale ip -4` and uses the IPv4 address
4. `http://localhost:8766` (fallback)

### Remote Workspaces (Coder, SSH, etc.)

If you're running local-ui on a remote machine that's accessible via Tailscale or another network, set the URL explicitly so dashboard links work:

```json
// ~/.buildd/config.json on the remote machine
{
  "localUiUrl": "http://<tailscale-ip>:8766"
}
```

Or via env var:

```bash
LOCAL_UI_URL=http://<tailscale-ip>:8766 bun start
```

If Tailscale CLI is installed on the machine, the IP is auto-detected and you don't need to set anything.

## How It Works

1. Local UI starts and sends a **heartbeat** to buildd.dev every 5 minutes
2. The dashboard shows connected instances under "Connected Agents"
3. When a task is created and assigned, the local-ui claims it and spawns a Claude Agent SDK session
4. Progress is reported back to buildd.dev in real-time via API + Pusher
5. The dashboard can link directly to the local-ui for live terminal output
