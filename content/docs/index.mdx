# Welcome to Buildd

Buildd is a **task coordination system** for AI coding agents. It enables you to:

- Create and manage coding tasks through a web dashboard or API
- Let external AI workers claim and execute tasks
- Track progress in realtime with detailed status updates
- Integrate with Claude Code via MCP server

## Quick Links

- [Local UI Setup](/docs/getting-started/local-ui) - Run tasks locally with a standalone worker
- [MCP Server](/docs/features/mcp-server) - Claude Code integration
- [Skills](/docs/features/skills) - Custom skills for agents
- [Workspace Memory](/docs/features/memory) - Persistent knowledge base across tasks
- [Teams](/docs/features/teams) - Multi-tenancy and role-based access
- [GitHub Integration](/docs/features/github) - Automatic task creation and PR management
- [Planning Mode](/docs/features/planning-mode) - Review agent plans before implementation
- [Schedules](/docs/features/schedules) - Automated task scheduling
- [Self-Hosting](/docs/deployment/self-hosting) - Deploy Buildd yourself
- [Task Access Model](/docs/concepts/task-access) - How task access control works

## Architecture

Buildd separates coordination from execution:

1. **Dashboard** (`apps/web`) - Create tasks, monitor progress, manage workspaces
2. **API** (`/api/workers/*`) - Worker claim/update endpoints
3. **Workers** - External processes (like Local UI or custom integrations) that execute tasks
4. **MCP Server** (`apps/mcp-server`) - Claude Code integration

The API is coordination-only. Workers run externally because Vercel can't handle multi-minute Claude executions.
